# odin_todo_list
Odin project practice task.

The finished project goal is to be able to create projects which themselves include tasks (to do lists), each task will be marked with urgency (color), title, due by date, and a description which will only be visible upon expanding the task. Tasks may be added and deleted as required by user.
